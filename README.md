# the batholith project

A project in which I am experimenting with GtkAda to make a personal finance application.
This project mostly stems from my interest in the ADA programming language and my love for statistics.
Additionnaly I'm using CSS and GLADE.
Please check out and support the GtkAda project on GitHub on https://github.com/AdaCore/gtkada
